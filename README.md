# Challenges

- Add favourites or remove favourites from Top Picks (if you click the heart it should be saved as favourite and the heart should be solid red, otherwise it should be empty and not be a favourite)
- Add Ability to remove favourite from favourite list
- Enhance search to render map using Google Maps using the lon and lat.
- Add more properties to the database and test the markers on the map
- Add places of interest using Google Maps by adding pins for restaurants, schools and hospitals.

# Bonus (Use Miro if you want to brainstorm)

- Add Register and Login capabilities (this would require changing the staybae-server)
- Add Register/Login on single page as a tabbed container (one tab Register, the other login). One submit button should be enough.
- Add context for user details (i.e. name of the person and their ID) - if logged in, show their profile, if logged out show 'register/login' button
