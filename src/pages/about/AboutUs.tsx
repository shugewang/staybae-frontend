        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl"> Our story</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          StayBae was born out of a passion for exploration and a desire to
          break away from the mundane. Our founders, avid travelers themselves,
          often found that the most memorable parts of their trips were the
          unique places they stayed in – cozy cabins nestled in serene
          landscapes, chic lofts with panoramic city views, treehouses perched
          amidst lush greenery, and so much more. They realized that traditional
          accommodations couldn't always capture the magic of a destination.
          Thus, StayBae was established to curate a diverse collection of
          accommodations that reflect the heart and soul of each location. From
          the quaint and charming to the modern and luxurious, we handpick stays
          that offer more than just a bed – they offer an immersive experience.
        </p>

          on a journey of a lifetime, one extraordinary stay at a time.
